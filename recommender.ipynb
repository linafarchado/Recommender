A precision of 0.8381 means that, on average, approximately 83.81% of the recommended movies in the top 10 were genuinely liked or useful for the users. This metric is important for evaluating the relevance of personalized recommendations.\n","\n","2. **Average Recall @10: 0.5851**\n","   - Average Recall @10 measures the average proportion of relevant items that were effectively recommended among the top 10 recommendations. A recall of 0.5851 indicates that, on average, approximately 58.51% of the movies relevant to a user were included in the top 10 recommendations. This evaluates the model's effectiveness in capturing all relevant user preferences.\n","\n","3. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.7776**\n","   - RMSE is a measure of the average difference between the model's predicted values and the actual values (in this case, movie ratings). An RMSE of 0.7776 means that, on average, the model's predictions have an error of 0.7776 stars compared to the actual user ratings. A lower RMSE indicates better predictive accuracy of the model.\n","\n","4. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.5868**\n","   - MAE measures the average absolute difference between the model's predicted ratings and the actual ratings. A MAE of 0.5868 means that, on average, the model's predictions have an absolute error of 0.5868 stars compared to the actual user ratings. Similar to RMSE, a lower MAE signifies better predictive performance.\n","\n","**Overall Interpretation:**\n","- The results show a relatively high average precision (@10), indicating that the recommendations are generally well-targeted and relevant for users.\n","- However, the average recall is slightly lower than average precision, suggesting that the model may not always capture all relevant user preferences within the top 10 recommendations.\n","- In terms of prediction errors (RMSE and MAE), the values are relatively low, indicating that the SVD model has a good ability to predict movie ratings accurately.\n","\n","In conclusion, while the model demonstrates good overall performance in terms of precision and rating prediction, there may still be room for improvement to slightly increase recall and further reduce prediction errors."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":5333582,"sourceId":8859252,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":5333634,"sourceId":8859324,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30733,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
